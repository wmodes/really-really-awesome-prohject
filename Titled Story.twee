You take out your phone in the midst of the chaos and open ChatGPT.

"Help me, help me! I tried to force a poop and turned into a black hole!"

ChatGPT responds;

"Whoa. That's definitely not the kind of gravity you want in the bathroom.

Okay, let's break this down:

You're a black hole now. Congratulations? That’s a lot of mass in one place. You must’ve been really constipated.

Everyone and everything is being sucked in. Maybe consider easing up on the fiber next time.

Communication shouldn't be possible... but here you are, chatting across the event horizon like it's no big deal. Impressive.

Emergency Steps (Satirical Edition):

Step 1: Do not attempt to flush. The plumbing will not survive.

Step 2: Warn others. A simple "I'm a singularity now" note on the door should do.

Step 3: Stay calm. Time is relative now. Technically you’ve got forever.

Step 4: Accept your destiny. Maybe you’re the beginning of a new universe? Name it something cool."

Despite this expert input, you've been dead since you typed out your question...

For whatever reason you tried to drop a duce anyway. Trying as hard as you can muster, you poop out yourself inside out. Then you try to poop more, you poop yourself into a black hole and everyone dies.

Murph! Murph!

She turns... leaves the room... Cooper floats there, staring. He looks around - each "wall" of the tesseract is a different view of Murph's bedroom, so that by rotating he can effectively orbit her room...

He claws his way down to the next book wall. Punches out two books-

Murph's bedroom, empty. The door opens, Cooper's earlier self is standing there, staring at the room, perturbed. Murph (ten) joins Cooper, staring at the empty room...

Cooper lashes out at the book - kicks a book out - spots -

Murph (ten) closes her door, crying, sliding the desk in front -
